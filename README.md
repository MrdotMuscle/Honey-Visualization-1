# Honey-Visualization
<p>The purpose of the first visualization is to highlight the relationship between the honey production of each state and the average price per pound from 1998 to 2012. The hope is that users can see not only the relationship of the average price, honey production and the stocks held by the producers in each state, but also compare these values across the different states.</p>
<p>The purpose of the second visualization is to give viewers impressions of yield per colony in states in the form of geoAlbersUsa projection. The purpose is that viewers can see yield per colony in each state, and compare the amount according to the depth of color. Viewers can not only compare the annual honey production of each state, but also compare the annual average yield per colony distribution by changing the year from 1998 to 2012.</p>
